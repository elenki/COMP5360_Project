## Project Title:
Chronic Disease Prevalence in the United States: A Social Determinants of Health Perspective

<br> 

## Project Objectives:
1. To analyze the prevalence of chronic diseases in the United States
2. Determine the impact of social determinants of health on chronic disease prevalence
3. Build a predictive model to identify high-risk populations for chronic diseases

<br> 

## Project Description:
Chronic diseases are a major public health concern in the United States, affecting millions of people and costing billions of dollars in healthcare expenses. The prevalence of chronic diseases is influenced by a variety of factors, including social determinants of health such as income, education, and access to healthcare. This project aims to analyze the prevalence of chronic diseases in the United States and identify the impact of social determinants of health on chronic disease prevalence. 

The project will use data from the CDC Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) and PLACES: Local Data for Better Health for this analysis. 

The project will also build a predictive model to identify high-risk populations for chronic diseases that can help inform public health interventions and policies.

## Data Sources:
1. CDC Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) - https://www.cdc.gov/cdi/
2. PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, Place Data 2023 release - https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Place-Data-202/eav7-hnsx/about_data
3. SDOH Measures for Place, ACS 2017-2021 - https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/SDOH-Measures-for-Place-ACS-2017-2021/edkk-ze78/about_data

<br> 

## Tools:
- Python, Jupyter Notebook

<br> 

## Methodology:
1. Using "PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, Place Data 2023 release" dataset, we will analyze the prevalence of chronic diseases in the United States.
   * We will employ exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in chronic disease prevalence.
   * We will visualize the data using various plots and charts to communicate the findings.
2. Using "SDOH Measures for Place, ACS 2017-2021" dataset, we will determine the impact of social determinants of health on chronic disease prevalence.
   * We will analyze the relationship between social determinants of health and chronic disease prevalence.
   * We will use statistical methods to identify significant associations between social determinants of health and chronic disease prevalence.
   * Statistical methods may include correlation analysis and regression analysis. Correlation analysis will help us identify the relationship between social determinants of health and chronic disease prevalence. Regression analysis will help us determine the impact of social determinants of health on chronic disease prevalence.
3. We will build a predictive model to identify high-risk populations for chronic diseases.
    * Based on the findings from the analysis, we will build a predictive model to identify high-risk populations for chronic diseases.
    * The model will use social determinants of health data to predict chronic disease prevalence.
    * High-risk populations identified by the model can help inform public health interventions and policies.
